# breadcord
Ambitious and absolutely pathetic Discord bot made with `SinisterRectus/Discordia`
This is mainly for hobby bots or something, I don't plan on trying to wrap my head around the new Intents bullshit, and slash commands are extremely gay. Discord has been making questionable API decisions for some time now, and it demotivates me.

If you don't have a config.json, run `luvit breadcord` in the command line and it *should* create a config.cfg with a default prefix and token keys in it, replace `YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE` with your token.
If for any reason it doesn't make a config.cfg, tell me first, and then you can create it manually. Create a text file called `config.cfg`, replacing the extension, and paste this into it: `{"Prefix":"bd_","Token":"YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"}`

If you have questions, concerns about my schizophrenic lua style, or ideas, feel free to use issues or discussions, if you care enough of course.
